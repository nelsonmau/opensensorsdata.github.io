#### What is archeostickers
Archeostickers are a pack of sticker for [Telegram](http://telegram.me). Follow The [instruction](http://archeostickers.com/pages/istruzioni/) to install

#### Who created archeostickers
Archeostickers are a product [opensensorsdata](#contact) in partnership with (our dear friends) [Professione Archeologo](http://www.professionearcheologo.it/) and [ArcheoPop](http://www.civettadiatena.it/).

#### Why we did create archeosticker
We mainly want to:

* show that art and archeology can be used for gaming and iconic communication
* reuse the enormous wealth of images and information available on [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)
* advocate for concrete reuse case of open-licensed art

#### We also wanted to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/archeostickers) <small>- like the [osd's site](https://github.com/opensensorsdata/opensensorsdata.github.io) -</small> because:

* They are important tools, increasingly being used in the commercial world
* it is a great excuse to bring humanists to the fantastic world of coding
* because they are free, and with a little practice they can empower you to perform more and more
* code (well ... codes) are nothing more than languages: those involved in archeology, those who learned art did learn ​​much more complicated languages ... so you have no excuses!

#### Archeostickers love Wikipedia
Archival fatigue, cataloguing and compiling shared knowledge should not go wasted.

All that has been compiled, written, edited, and uploaded to Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons is heritage that is there to be reused. 

This is why every image used to create an archeosticker is taken from Wikimedia Commons and likewise the single archeosticker is **reusable in return also for commercial purposes**.

<big>We hope this will spread other reuse cases.</big>

Recognize reuse - and attributing the source - means laying the foundations of their work and putting it in a “chain” where the value is given not by its *exclusivity* but by its **availability**.

#### Archeostickers are freely reusable
ALL archeostickers are reusable - even for commercial purposes - because we release them under [CreativeCommons ShareAlike Attribution](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and [the same website](https://github.com/archeostickers/archeostickers.github.io) can be downloaded and - of course - reused, with only two clause:

* tell others that we made them (archeostickers)
* share them the same way

<small>(example: you can make and sell a book with our archeostickers but you can not have either the exclusivity of them or even put the nice words "all rights reserved") 
archeostickers are built on openly reusable culture that has been shared</small>
