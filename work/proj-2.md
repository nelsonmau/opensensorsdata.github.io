#### What’s it?
Datastickers (DS) is a tool to transmit and share either sensors’ data or common databases. This flow take place by automatic rendering into icons, a  cluster of language and images. Datastickers act inside conversations and  convert data for its active connections. Ultimately, his goal is to improve the quality of human/machine interaction by producing stream-contents which are familiar and participative for people and professionals. 


#### Value Proposition
Value proposal focus on building up a particular business model over:

* promoting people’s competences and skills in use within the organizational structure
* reducing costs of data dissemination.

First aim for (DS) is to endorse and appraise technical and professional skills behind the data managing and creation that, often – especially for agencies strongly canalized toward highly specialistic research activities– are complicated to integrate within normal activities. 
Second aim is to integrate this activity at reduced cost, increasing accessibility and adoption for these agency, as mentioned above, that do not include dissemination as core activity of their business frame.
To summarized, low cost of adoption, high grade of integration within different set of tasks *(1)*. 
Iconic rendering, central element of contemporary cyberculture (gif, meme, so on) weaken the dependence between the understanding of the information and the personal capacities of interpretation, growing the potential interest into the data set.


#### Technical Specification
Datastickers’ elements are code, images and expressive variables that interpret and respond in automatic fashion to prefixed conversational attitudes. Messages are generated from connected databases and produced by reusing the machine’s information, either from low frequencies update (statistical db) or from real-time flow (sensors’ data).
For both services and API can be offered to meet:

* value goals (as described in  *(1)* ). 
* focus on data optimization and shareability.

The first example of Datastickers is **[PorcellinoBot](http://telegram.me/porcellinobot)** for rendering climate data in Firenze. PorcellinoBot is made (with love) by osd and [CNR Ibimet](http://www.ibimet.cnr.it/)
